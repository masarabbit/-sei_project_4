## Overview 
This was the second project I did at General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Course - we had 48 hours to create a web app in pairs. We chose to make a Pokédex featuring the 151 first generation Pokémon, using [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

I had only just learnt React, and this was also the first time I had coded with someone else. In this ReadMe I have summarised my experience. I mainly worked on styling and animating the page, but I will also explain the logic behind the API requests and filters since I also contributed to these elements. Since we were taking the course remotely, we used Live Share on VS Code to pair code.

## Final Thoughts

### Wins and Challenges
It was the first time for me to make a web app in pairs, and I was still relatively new to working with React and API, so there was a lot to take in. On top of this we only had 48 hours so it was a major task. 

At the beginning it took longer to get started because we had to calibrate out ideas, but the process helped make the concept clearer, and in the end I was able to achieve much more than I could on my own. I felt that splitting the task worked well, because I was able to focus a lot on styling. 

We chose to use Bulma for some of the CSS. I found myself fighting against Bulma at times, but it was useful for getting things into shape quickly, such as the stats bar and form fields. Having said this, if I were to make something similar in the future, I would probably write my own CSS to have better control.
